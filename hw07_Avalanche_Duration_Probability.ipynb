    "Calculate the avalanche duration probability $P_>(t)$ if $\\lambda i = \\lambda$ for all $t$ and all neurons. This leads, as only sketched in class, to the following integral: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\gamma \\int_0^\\infty d\\lambda \\cdot \\exp(-\\gamma\\lambda)\\cdot(1-\\exp(-\\delta\\lambda))^n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which can be solved through the saddle point approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional. Create a time series $\\lambda(t)$, with $t=1,2,...,T$ where at each time $t$, the value of $\\lambda$ is extracted from an exponential distribution. Then simulate $N=100$ independent heterogeneous Poisson processes, where each one describes the spikes events of a single neuron, but all have the same time dependent rate parameter $\\lambda(t)$."
